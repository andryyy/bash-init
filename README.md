# bash-init

Pure bash init system, a work in progress.

No coreutils, just bash.

- Dedicated process groups per service container for proper signal handling
  - Commands and jobs in containers will re-use the service containers process group
- Messaging via environment files per service
- Dependencies
- Periodic commands
- Auto-installation of system packages (Alpine, Debian)
  - Auto-setup of Python virtualenvs if package name is "py:name"
  - Auto-installation of Go packages when package name is "go:name"
- Health checks (HTTP and TCP probes)
- Restart policies
- Service container stats
- Custom reload signals (properly sent to command PID only)
- Custom stop signals (sent to a service containers process group)
- Run service as uid:gid
- Prepend stdout/stderr of each service for a better overview
- No zombies üßü‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Running a service with a predefined uid/gid will auto-install su-exec resp. gosu.
For Python services bash-init requires "chown" to set proper permissions in the virtualenv.

Documentation soon. Really. I'm serious.

**Todo**

- Documentation
- Isolation (will most likely require non-bash dependencies)
  - Chroot/Container/Cgroups
- Restricted bash for service commands
- Validate configuration parameter types
- CPU usage
  - Read CPU ticks in a fixed time frame and put it in reference to CONFIG_HZ
- Write tests
- Write notifiers
- Do not use "text" in functions but use general lang files according to return codes
  - funcname[$return_code]="string"
